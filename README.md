# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

# Calle Onse

<p>Is a Milestone Project Website I created for the requirement of User Centric Front End Development Project.<p>
<p>I created a responsive single scrolling page for the fans of a new band Calle Onse the goal is the users can easily listen to their favourite tracks and watch the latest videos,And also to get up to date from other social media platforms.

## UX

The website is designed to provide both new and old fans a simple and easy to use interface to connect with the band.
The website also provides for the fans/potential clients to contact the band and get hired for special occasions/events.

The users stories and planning stage of creating different features for this website are base on:

* As a fan, A platform to listen to their latest music and where to download.
* As a fan, A platform to watch the latest Videos.
* As a fan, A platform where the fans can view the latest photos.
* As a fan, A platform where the fans can get updated about all recent news and developments thru newsletter.
* As a fan, A platform where the fans can get access to the latest tour dates and where to get tickets and direction to the event.
* As a fan, A way for the future clients to contact and hire the band for special events.
* As a fan, A Platform fans can find links to the bands Social Media which can be easily shared with new fans.


The development of the website was modeled based from the user stories.
